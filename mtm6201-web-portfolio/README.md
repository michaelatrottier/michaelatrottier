On the home page, I had issues at first putting space between the "contact" link and the rest of the nav. I originally separated the contact from the rest of the nav (I don't know why I thought that would be a good idea) which made the nav uneven when you would resize the page. I then realized I could keep the nav all in one and use the id on the contact link to target it and give it a left margin of 20% to divide it. 

I also had issues with resizing the first image on the home screen so that it would still look good when at tablet or mobile size. I decided to make an image switch once the screen hit tablet size by using display:none; to hide the original image and display a new one. The second image I used for tablet and mobile fits the screen size better than the image for desktop. 

On the about page I didnt run into too many issues. The only thing was getting the back-end section to go onto the second row to make space for the education and front-end section on top on the mobile version. 

On the contact page I also didn't run into too many issues. The only one was when I added my photo onto the page, the form began to separate on the desktop version and wouldn't even out. I finally got it to an alright place after playing with the CSS. 

My "work" page is still a work in progress because unfortunately I ran out of time. I would like to figure out how to store multiple images in one section so that when you click on it, it displays all the images from that specific project. I thought I could maybe use bootstrap to do this page, but I would like to learn how to do it from scratch with JavaScript. I am looking forward to taking a class focused on JavaScript in the fall. I did learn the basics in web programming 1, but look forward to learning it more in depth. 

All my CSS and HTML files validate with no errors. The JavaScript file does not (I checked with a vaildator online). 

I did not use any frameworks, libraries, plugins, or images that were not my own. 
I did use the Montserrat Google font.

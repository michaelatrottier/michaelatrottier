            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p><br><br>Orange Art Gallery has become a permanent player in Ottawa's growing arts
                scene since opening in April 2010. We represent a very talented group of
                contemporary artists from Ottawa and the surrounding areas. Orange Art
                Gallery has relocated to the "Hipster and Trendy" City Centre Area and will
                re-open the doors in Spring 2014. Our new home is a beautiful historic
                building which used to house the Bank for CN rail 100 years ago. The 5000
                sqft building is being renovated to feature local contemporary art and will
                include art studios and catering in the lower level. The New Orange will
                continue to offer a unique venue space to celebrate wedding receptions,
                parties etc. and there is plenty of parking. Orange Art Gallery is open 11
                am to 5 pm from Wednesday to Sunday and open late every Thursday night until
                9 pm. In 2013 we made it possible for you to also purchase art online. If you
                like to take advantage of this, go to the artists page on our website and
                select the artist of interest. The selected artist page displays PayPal buttons
                for available art items for sale online. Clicking on a PayPal button adjacent
                to the image brings you to a PayPal page to take care of completing a secure
                transaction. PayPal accepts several credit cards. Free shipping is available
                for customers located in Canada and the USA Orange Art Gallery also works
                closely with interior designers, decorators and home stagers to help them
                find the perfect artwork for their residential and commercial clients.
